# Spotify-Song-Recommender
Flask web app using the Spotify API that allows a user to generate a playlist of song recommendations based off one of their playlists.

User can sign into account, and after selecting a playlist a new playlist of recommendations is created in their account. Main file is recommender.py.

Note - since this project is connected to an app on the Spotify API which is in development mode, anyone who wishes to run the web app will need to be added to a list of allowed users - please contact me at samjjordan24@gmail.com to get access.

Additionally, details stored as repository secrets will need to be replaced with those sourced from an app on your own Spotify API dashboard if downloading the repository.
